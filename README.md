This is very, very dumb.

I have been writing my static site stuff in a text editor using shell scripts. I miss a more GUI/WYSIWYG writing environment. MarsEdit is a good one.

So, I wrote the simplest possible thing to let me do just that. This is that.

It does not conform to micropub/xmlrpc standards. I don't need it to.
It has no security. I don't need it to. It runs locally in my static publishing env.
